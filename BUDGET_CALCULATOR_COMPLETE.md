## 🔧 Final Setup Steps

### 1. Add Perplexity API Key

**Location:** `.env` file in project root

```bash
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Get your key:** https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api

### 2. Restart Local Server

```bash
# Kill any existing server
kill $(lsof -ti:5000)

# Start fresh
node server.js
```

Server will start on http://localhost:5000

### 3. Test Locally

1. Visit http://localhost:5000
2. Generate a route (e.g., Aix-en-Provence → Barcelona)
3. Select agents (try multiple for best results)
4. Click "Generate Route"
5. **Watch for budget cards** appearing under each agent's route!

**What you'll see:**
- Loading skeleton while calculating
- Budget card with total and per-person costs
- Visual breakdown bar
- Expandable details with full breakdown
- Money-saving tips
- Best time to travel info

### 4. Deploy to Heroku

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add budget calculator with Perplexity integration"
git push heroku main
```

**Then:**
1. Set Perplexity API key on Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
2. Check logs: `heroku logs --tail`
3. Test on production URL

## 📋 Testing Checklist

Before going live, test these scenarios:

### Happy Path
- [ ] Generate route with 1 agent → See budget
- [ ] Generate route with multiple agents → See budget for each
- [ ] Expand budget details → See full breakdown
- [ ] Compare budgets between agents
- [ ] Check savings tips are relevant

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Very short trip (2 days) → Budget still calculates
- [ ] Long trip (10 days) → Budget scales correctly
- [ ] Budget level "budget" → Lower costs
- [ ] Budget level "luxury" → Higher costs
- [ ] Modified route with added cities → Budget updates

### Error Handling
- [ ] Wrong API key → Shows fallback budget with warning
- [ ] API timeout → Retries then shows fallback
- [ ] Network error → Shows error message gracefully

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before (Old)
```
Adventure Route to Barcelona
- Cities: Perpignan, Girona, Barcelona
- [No budget information]
```

### After (Now)
```
Adventure Route to Barcelona
- Cities: Perpignan, Girona, Barcelona
- Estimated Cost: €1,847 (€924/person)
  ✓ Transport: €318 | Hotels: €440 | Dining: €780 | Activities: €240

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Budget calculation unavailable"

**Cause:** Perplexity API key not set or invalid

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check if key is set
heroku config:get PERPLEXITY_API_KEY

# Set it if missing
heroku config:set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Restart dynos
heroku restart
```

### Issue: Budgets loading forever

**Cause:** API timeout or network issue

**Fix:**
- Check backend logs: `heroku logs --tail | grep Budget`
- Verify Perplexity API status
- Check if fallback budget appears (static estimate)

### Issue: Budget shows "€0"

**Cause:** JSON parsing error from Perplexity response

**Fix:**
- Check logs for parsing errors
- Perplexity might have returned non-JSON
- Retry should fix (automatic 3 retries built in)

### Issue: Old frontend loading (no budget cards)

**Cause:** Browser cache

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console
- Check Network tab to verify loading `index-CespUEmT.js`

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Optional)
- [ ] Add "travelers" input to form (currently defaults to 2)
- [ ] Add "duration" slider to customize trip length
- [ ] Budget comparison chart across all agents
- [ ] Export budget to PDF
- [ ] Currency conversion (€ → $, £, etc.)

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] Historical price tracking
- [ ] Price drop alerts
- [ ] Budget vs actual tracking (post-trip)
- [ ] Split costs by traveler

## 💰 Revenue Potential

**Current State:** Budget information only

**Next Step:** Add booking integration
- Hotels: 4-6% commission (Booking.com API)
- Activities: 10-15% commission (GetYourGuide)
- Restaurants: 5-10% commission (OpenTable/TheFork)

**Projected Revenue:**
- 1,000 trips/month × €40 avg commission = **€40,000/month**
- Budget calculator helps users commit to bookings
- Clear costs = higher conversion rates

---
